# CubeCoders-AMP-Server-Docker
Docker container running cube coder's amp server for minecraft and many other home hosted servers

There are two ways to run this container, the first being less secure and uncustomizable to start out with, but everything can be changed once it's up and running. 
The second is fully customizable and recommended for advanced users who are very familiar with linux. 

Just copy and paste whichever method you prefer into you command terminal and follow prompts.

1) curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piersonjarvis/CubeCoders-AMP-Server-Docker/master/ServerInstall.sh | sh

2) curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piersonjarvis/CubeCoders-AMP-Server-Docker/master/CustomServerInstall.sh && chmod 755 CustomServerInstall.sh && ./CustomServerInstall.sh
